## Introduction

---

## Background

<!--
A 1-page summary of the contributions of the paper in [1]. Discuss why the authors of [1] think the topic of their paper is useful, a summary of the implementation of the adaptive method (how does it work?), and their experiment design and results. Also include some examples or particular situations where you think their results could be useful for the scientific community or industry.
-->

<!-- TODO -->

---

## Theoretical Analysis

<!--
Uses an abstract model to estimate the crossover point analytically. You can provide this based on a review of academic papers and the textbook but make sure you explain it clearly and discuss the structure, constants, assumptions, and limitations of the theoretical model.
-->

<!-- TODO -->

---

## Methodology

<!-- in which you explain Strassens Algorithm, standard matrix multiplication and give pseudocode and further explanation. Include your runtime analysis from Part 2 here. -->

<!-- TODO -->

---

## Experiment Design

<!-- describes your implementation of the two algorithms and the way you generate test problems (ie matrices to multiply). -->

<!-- TODO -->

---

## Empirical Analysis

<!-- provides your results of parts 3 and 4 evaluating the adaptive method for matrix multiplication, Strassenâ€™s algorithm, and the basic method. You should use [1] as an example of the type of results you should put in this section (tables, graphs, type of discussion) because when marking will expect to see graphs and results that are of comparable quality to this and measure similar quantities. -->
