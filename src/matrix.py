    A data structure for matrix. The matrix implementation should be suitable for dense matrices. You are required to
    define a class Matrix that will be used in the implementation. This class Matrix will represent a matrix in
    “row-major” order (i.e. for an n×n-matrix the first row will be stored in an array at index 0 to index n-1 the
    next row at n to 2n-1 and so on). The class should provide a constructor and methods to get and set the element
    at any row column index.
